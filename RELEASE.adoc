To release Hawkular Services, you'll need a JBoss.org Account with the appropriate permissions to the target repository.

Releasing Hawkular Services is done the same way as other Maven projects:

```
$ mvn release:prepare release:perform
```

Another option is to use Torii, a Red Hat internal machine:
https://jenkins.torii.gva.redhat.com/job/hawkular-services/

Once logged in, the option "Perform Maven Release" is available. Just click on it and "Schedule Maven Release Build".
This will basically do a `mvn -Prelease-guiless release:prepare release:perform`, which postpones the uploading to the
end of the build and automatically closes/releases the Nexus repository. The job also triggers some other post-release
tasks, such as creating a GitHub release with the appropriate assets.
